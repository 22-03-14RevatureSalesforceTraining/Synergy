 * Last updated March 20th, 2022
 * This page was created to introduce Bangkok both visually,
 * and through an introduction to someone passionate about
 * blogging and photography
 * The majority of this work came from knowledge gleaned as a Revature
 * trainee, but javascript portion ultimately became something not my own.
 * after spending a morning with a youtube video titled:
 * "How to code a carousel with HTML, CSS, and Javascript from Scratch"
 * By Kevin Powell
 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBzsE0oieio
 * The javascript used for my carousel was very closely modeled his example.
 * Several of my CSS selectors were subsequently changed to match his
 * example after watching/re-watching/re-re-watching his video
 * The scope of my project narrowed, and HTML was shed to a single destination.

                    How is the thought of a trip to Thailand? It must sound
                    pretty good if you made it to this page. You have good
                    taste in destinations, but do you have the whole story.
                    I spent most of the last eleven years living in Thailand
                    and I can tell you that while it's my favorite spot on 
                    Earth, it's also a mixed-bag that is likely half a world 
                    away from where you're sitting. A trip like this should 
                    begin with research. Perhaps your research will begin here.

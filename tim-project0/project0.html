            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I am 25 years old, turning 26 in May.</li>
                <li>I graduated Western Michigan University with a 
                    Bachelor's in Computer Science. </li>
                <li>My best friends are my girlfriend, Kelsey, and my
                    dog, Jess (Pitbull/Boxer mix). </li>
                <li>My hobbies are gaming, hanging
                    out with friends, sports, and poker. </li>
                <li>Before I started at Revature I was playing online 
                    poker "professionally" </li>

            <h2>My Future Goals</h2>
            <p> Revature is just the beginning! They have given me this
                amazing opportunity to kickstart my career. I hope to grow 
                from this and become a Senior Software Engineer (or Salesforce Architect?)
                in the future. This will give me the financial stability to do
                something I've always wanted to do: travel the world! I can also
                combine this with one of my favorite pastimes, poker. There are many
                major poker tournaments in big cities across the world: 
                <a href="https://www.pokerstarslive.com/ept/prague/">Prague</a>, 
                <a href="https://www.pokerstarslive.com/espt/madrid/">Madrid</a>, and 
                <a href="https://www.pokerstarslive.com/ept/montecarlo/">Monte Carlo</a>,
                just to name a few. With a solid career to support me, I can finally
                participate in some of these events that I have been dreaming of for almost
                a decade. Not to mention the sites that I will see! I am excited to start 
                this phase of my life and I thank you for reading this and being part of it.
